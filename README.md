# Exercise for Spam Filtering using Naive Bayes Classifier with Laplace Smoothing

## Task
Create a program that will take message files and classify them as spam or ham using a naive bayes classifier with laplace smoothing

## Input

- the filename of the file to be classified
- classification of the message in the file
- computed probability

## Reminders
